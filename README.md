<h2>SQL Project 4</h2>
Samira, a regional branch manager, is evaluating interest impact on long-term mortgage loans. She wants to study how efficiently interest is distributed over time. For each mortgage loan with a term longer than 36 months and a moderate interest rate, she needs to analyze how much interest the borrower effectively pays per month. She’s reviewing loan ID, loan amount, term, rate, and this monthly interest metric.
